# tick-tock

This isn't software so I'm not sure if it needs a readme but here goes. 

tick-tock is a repo of files used to make working clocks. 
Progress will be included as working things are made by me (Rey). 
Began as an assignment for programming class but evolved into something of a passion project. 
I know there's better ways to do this and I'm gonna find them all. 
Unsure if whatever you're reading this on will wrap automatically so I'll hit enter. 

Written using JavaFX in Eclipse Oxygen.

I owe Teresa Brooks my education.

I owe the following people/organizations some kind of credit (do developers have bibliographies?): 
https://www.mkyong.com/java/java-how-to-get-current-date-time-date-and-calender/
the Oracle Java and JavaFX documentation

INCLUDED: 
Main.java (one copy, unchanged just in case)
DisplayClock.java (first assignment, based on Pearson code and instructor examples, not all mine but the first iteration) 
ClockPane.java (the bones of the ticking clock, based on DisplayClock but divided from the animations etc)
Timepiece.java (the mechanism and the driver)

LONG TERM GOALS: 
Create one timepiece that can drive any clock I can dream up. I can dream up a lot of clocks, so I need to write something that is
highly reusable, 
flexible, 
concise, 
efficient, 
I also would like to use this project to learn about skinning things with CSS. 

CURRENT VERSION: 
v.2
analog and digital clock (run Timepiece.java...uses ClockPane.java) updates each second
second sweep seems a bit off to me, but stayed with system clock for at least 30 minutes (tested)
next changes will be to streamline and improve code 
I would have written a shorter program but I hadn't the time.
